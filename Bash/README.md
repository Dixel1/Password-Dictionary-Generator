## Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the bash script (slow one, python is prefered) works:
- The script first sets some variables. max_length is the maximum length of the passwords to be generated, and output_file is the name of the file where the passwords will be stored. chars is an array of all possible characters that can be used in the passwords.
- Then prints a message to the console to let the user know that the password dictionary generation has started.
- The generate_combinations function is defined. This function takes two arguments: the current combination of characters (current) and the remaining length (len). If len is 0, it means that the current combination is a valid password, so it is printed to the console and appended to the output file. If len is not 0, the function calls itself recursively for each character in chars, each time appending one character to current and decrementing len by 1.
- Calls generate_combinations for each possible length from 0 to max_length. This generates all possible combinations of characters up to max_length.
- Finally, the script prints a message to the console to let the user know that the password dictionary generation is complete.
