## Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the powershell script (slowest one, python is prefered) works:
- The script starts by defining a few variables, min_length and max_length are the minimum and maximum lengths of the passwords to be generated. chars is a string containing all possible characters that can be used in the passwords. output_file is a file object that represents the file where the passwords will be written.
- Then prints a message to the console to let the user know that the password generation process is starting.
- The Generate-Combinations function is defined. This function takes two parameters: a string current and an integer len. The function generates all combinations of characters of length len, prefixed by the string current. If len is 0, it means that current is a complete password, so it writes current to the output file and prints it to the console. If len is not 0, it means that more characters need to be added to current to make a complete password. In this case, the function calls itself recursively for each character in chars, with current appended with the character and len decremented by 1.
- The script then enters a loop that goes from min_length to max_length. For each length, it calls the Generate-Combinations function with an empty string and the current length. This starts the process of generating all combinations of characters of the current length.
- Finally, the script prints a message to the console to let the user know that the password generation process is complete.

This script uses the concept of recursion, which is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. The Generate-Combinations function calls itself to generate all combinations of characters of a certain length. This is a common technique used in programming to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar problems.
