# Password-Dictionary-Generator
Those scripts are designed to generate a dictionary of possible combinations.

## Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the python script (actually the fastest one) works:
- It first defines the maximum length of the combinations (max_length) and the output file name (dictionary.txt).
- It then defines all possible characters (chars) that can be used in the combinations. This includes all lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation.
- The script then starts the password dictionary generation process and informs the user about it.
- It defines a recursive function generate_combinations that generates all possible combinations of the characters for a given length. For each combination, it writes the combination to the output file and also prints it to the console.
- The script then loops through all possible lengths from 0 to max_length, and for each length, it calls the generate_combinations function to generate all combinations of that length.
- Finally, it informs the user that the password dictionary generation is complete.

# DISCLAIMER : 
Please note that this script should be used responsibly. Generating a dictionary of passwords could potentially be used in a brute force attack, which is illegal and unethical without proper authorization. This script should only be used for legitimate purposes, such as penetration testing with permission or generating test data. Misuse of this script may result in legal consequences. Always respect privacy and consent.
